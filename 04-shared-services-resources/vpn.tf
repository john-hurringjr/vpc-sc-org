/*

I use a GCP project hosted in another Org for my fake "On Prem"
environment. You may ignore this if you want to configure your own VPN.

Note, I use thise file to comment in/out my VPN to help reduce cost
when I am not using the VPN for testing.

As mentioned in the readme, you will need to grant your TF service
account the appropriate permissions to your "on prem" gcp project.
